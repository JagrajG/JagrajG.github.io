                    PotHolePatrol was a hackathon project for StormHack-Summer 2024. 
                    Whilst driving my team and I would always struggles with Potholes.
                    We decided we wanted to change that. So we created PotHolePatrol.
                    User's can now report Potholes ensuring there communits are pothole 
                    free.
