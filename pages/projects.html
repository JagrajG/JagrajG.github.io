                    PotHolePatrol was a hackathon project for StormHack-Summer 2024. 
                    Whilst driving my team and I would always struggles with Potholes.
                    We decided we wanted to change that. So we created PotHolePatrol.
                    User's can now report Potholes ensuring there communits are pothole 
                    free.

                <p>
                    This project was made when I was learning node.js and its package manager.
                    I used inquirer and qr-image to generate this qr code image.
